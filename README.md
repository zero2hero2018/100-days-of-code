# About me
<br>
<p>I really didnt get into computers until i was a freshman in highschool.  It was only until i made a new friend that happened to be into computers and we talked and i was hooked.  I actually started on the hardware side.  The topic of HTML and CSS came up a few times but it was obviously very foreign to me and never thought it would be something i could do.  As the years went by i got more and more into computers and i always seemed to come back to html/css and programming in general.  I love having the ability to create something so complex and beautiful and interactive from nothing but text on a computer screen, and looking back and being able to say: "I made that!"</p>
<br>
 <p>Long story short,  here i am once again back to the wonderful world of website development and programming.  This time will be different.  I know that this is what i want to do and this is what im going to do.  I have my mind made up.  No more procrastinating, no more excuses!</p>
